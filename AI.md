# AI Assistance Log

I used AI tools in a limited way to support my work on this iP.  
The main tool was **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**, which I used occasionally to clarify error messages, check if my code met code
quality guidelines, and draft examples of commit messages.

## How AI Helped

- Suggested small refactorings, such as replacing “magic literals” with named constants and grouping help messages more
  clearly.
- Gave guidance when I encountered Git merge or Gradle build issues.
- Provided examples of how to format commit messages to follow SE-EDU conventions.
- Provided examples of what type of extensive Junit tests can be done

## Observations

- AI was most helpful for **quick feedback** on style and conventions.
- Some suggestions were not directly usable, and I had to simplify or adapt them myself.
- I relied on my own understanding for the design and final implementation. AI served more as a **guide or checker**
  than a code generator.
